# carabAoS

A toolbox for solving a variety of niche problems related to AoS (Warhammer: Age of Sigmar).

# Who is this for?

These tools are written in Python (as opposed to Rust <3) for accessibility. If you are a hobbyist hacker, or even if you're just code-curious, hopefully each tool is easy to use and understand. If you're a level above and want to integrate these into your own projects, hopefully the code is documented enough that you can ~~steal it~~ re-write it in your language of choice.

# What is in the toolbox?

# Why am I doing this?

I have no plans to build nice user interfaces or host websites, so my goal is for these tools to provide value to the community through either private use, or as part of an existing (or upcoming!) website - all I ask for in return is accreditation wherever the tools are used.
